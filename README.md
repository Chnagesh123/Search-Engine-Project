## Overview of Search-Engine-Project
In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital content consumption, accessibility to video content is
increasingly important. This project addresses the need for enhancing video accessibility by improving
the search relevance of subtitles, particularly focusing on the content within subtitles. The objective is to
develop an advanced search engine algorithm that efficiently retrieves subtitles based on user queries, emphasizing natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance relevance and
accuracy. This project uses between semantic search engines over traditional keyword-based search engines. As
keyword-based engines rely on exact matches between user queries and indexed documents, semantic
search engines delve deeper into understanding the meaning and context of queries and documents. The core logic involves three key steps: data preprocessing, vectorization of subtitle documents and user
queries, and cosine similarity calculation. Data preprocessing includes cleaning steps such as removing
timestamps to ensure accurate analysis. Vectorization converts textual data into numerical representations, facilitating comparison. Cosine similarity calculation measures the relevance of documents to the user's
query based on vector representations. By employing semantic search techniques, this project aims to provide more meaningful and relevant
search results for video subtitles, enhancing the accessibility of subtitle content for all users.
